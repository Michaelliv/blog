This is a meta post.

Right now, as I write this, I'm in a Claude Code session. Claude is helping me set up this blog, and now we're writing the first post together. That feels worth acknowledging.

The purpose of this blog is simple: a personal log for learnings and thoughts as I build and break stuff. No grand vision, no content strategy. Just notes from the trenches.

This blog is intended for builders. If you're here, you probably make things. You've probably broken things too. That's the territory.

More posts to come as I learn things worth sharing.
