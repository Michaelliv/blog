# Writing Guidelines

Guidelines for co-authoring blog posts - style, structure, and SEO.

**Status:** Actively learning

---

## SEO

- Description (120-160 chars): doubles as search snippet - make it compelling AND include key terms
- First paragraph: should contain words someone would Google
- Internal links: link to other posts naturally within content
- Title: what would someone search to find this?

---

## Voice & Tone

- Third person for about/bio content (like Simon Willison's style)
- First person for blog posts - direct, personal
- Short paragraphs, punchy
- No fluff, no filler phrases
- Conversational but not chatty

## Structure

- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- No headers needed for short posts
- End with forward-looking statement when appropriate

## Language

### Preferred Phrases
- "before and after" (not "along the way" when referring to multiple time periods)
- (more to be added)

### Avoid
- Overly casual first-person intros like "I'm X. At work they call me..."
- (more to be added)

## Technical Content

- TBD

## Learned Preferences Log

Each entry captures a preference discovered during editing.

1. **2025-11-28**: Prefers Simon Willison-style third person for bio/about content - factual, project-focused, no fluff
2. **2025-11-28**: "before and after" preferred over "along the way" when describing timeline spanning multiple periods
3. **2025-11-28**: First post approved - short paragraphs, direct first person, meta/self-aware tone works well, "notes from the trenches" vibe
4. **2025-12-15**: Concept pieces work at ~400 words. One concrete example sentence grounds abstract patterns. Mechanism explanations can be one sentence—don't over-explain.
5. **2025-12-15**: Good structure for concept posts: hook → pattern → mechanism → example → deeper principle → caveats → punchline

## Posts Written Together

1. **hi-chat-dev-here.md** (2025-11-28) - First post, meta intro to the blog. Approved first draft.
2. **anatomy-of-agentic-systems.md** (2025-11-28) - Technical intro to agentic systems. Headers work for longer technical posts.
3. **embedding-claude-code-sessions.mdx** (2025-11-28) - Meta post about building a ChatSession component. Uses the component it describes. MDX for component embedding.
4. **sandboxed-execution-environment.md** (2025-11-28) - Technical deep-dive on building sandboxed execution. Narrative framing works well (strategic bet → exploration → implementation). Code blocks interspersed with explanation.
5. **tool-design-is-all-about-the-flow.md** (2025-12-15) - Concept piece on agent tool design. Short (~400 words), one pattern (Search → View → Use), one example, punchy closer. Debate process helped tighten View/Use distinction.
